# Frontend masters workshop

## Prerequisites

-	Your own laptop with these things installed:
    -	Node.js + npm (can be downloaded from here: https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.3/node-v8.11.3-x64.msi)
    -	Your favourite IDE for building web. I will most likely be using Intellij IDEA, but you can use Atom (https://atom.io/) or VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    -	Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser
    -	(Optionally) Git (https://git-scm.com/) if you want to publish your project and work with it later. I will also publish the sources in our Gitlab so that you can use them later.
-	We will use this simplistic service: http://avatars.adorable.io/ to build our own Avatar generator
-	We are going to use https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app for building the application

## First steps

1.	Open bash or similar
2.	Install the tool via npm
    -	`npm install -g create-react-app`
3.	Once done, change directory to your work/project dir
    -	`cd /c/dev/work/` or similar
    -	`create-react-app frontend-masters`
    -	(depending on your OS this should take a couple of minutes)

## Let’s talk React!

This is a workshop, so no slides or whatsoever will be handed out. Best thing you can do is to follow official React documentation which is really superb. We will be handling only React in this workshop session(s). After that we may tackle advanced concepts (Redux, side-effect handling with React + Redux + Sagas, React router,…).
